Motivation :
The motivation for doing this project was primarily to make recruitment session smoother for students & make the complete Placement Process paperless at PIT. This is my small contribution, as the students of PIT, to the betterment of the system of Placements in PIT.

I am deeply thankful to T&P Authorities for approving my project to use as Official Placement Portal - PIT
